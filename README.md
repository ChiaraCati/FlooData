# üåä FlooData

FlooData is a project developed by Chiara Catizone and Giulia Venditti for the final exam of the course *Open Access and Digital Ethics* held by professor Monica Palmirani at the Master Course of Digital Humanities and Digital Knowldge (Univesity of Bologna) during the A.Y. 2021/2022.


## üéô Introduction 

Emilia Romagna is the sixth widest region in Italy in terms of surface area and it has a variegated hydrogeological conformation. This variety offers a moltitude of ecoystems currently undergoing drastic transformations due to climate change as stated by the Emilia Romagna's *Regional Environmental Protection Agency* ( [ARPAE](https://www.arpae.it/it) ) in its report on [Climate change in Emilia-Romagna](https://agricoltura.regione.emilia-romagna.it/produzioni-agroalimentari/temi/bio-agro-climambiente/cambiamento-climatico-in-emilia-romagna). Also, the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale), [ISPRA](https://www.isprambiente.gov.it/it), stated Emilia Romagna's morphology is extremely frigile due to intense weather events and  proneness to landslides of the territory.

Our first objective is, thus, the analyis of the relationship between idrogeological damages and the measures undertaken by different actors consdering them at local, national and (maybe) international level.  

Damages were, then, divided into two categories:

* **Damages on the coast** (mostly damages caused by sea events)
* **Damages on the mainland** (damages cused by floods and earth-quakes)

This distinction was introduced as we elaborated our second objective: whether there is a distinction in terms of risk perception towards these two different areas.

Finally, information on damages has been crossed with information on different kind of activities, mainly distinguishing between preventive measures and reparatory interventions. This further distinction was made with the aim to make explicit the amount of involvement of local and larger scale institutions (both from the private and public, if possible) in the preservation of this territory.


Through this project our aim is to give a clear view over risky areas triangulated with quantitative data on chatastrophic events and data on related activities(formulare un po' meglio).


## üèû Scenario

**ISPRA** is also the institution that created some Open Data repositories we relied on, when gathering the original data for building FlooData. 
[LinkedIspra](http://dati.isprambiente.it/) is their pilot project oh production of Linked Open Data following W3S guidelines. It is represented by a Catalog (issued in 2016) of 5 datasets:  
* [ReNDiS](http://dati.isprambiente.it/dataset/il-rendis/), the National Directory of Soil Defense Interventions
* [CDS](http://dati.isprambiente.it/dataset/cds/), theLand Consumption in Italy
* [RMN](http://dati.isprambiente.it/dataset/rmn-la-rete-mareografica-nazionale/), the  National Mareographic Network
* [RON](http://dati.isprambiente.it/dataset/ron-rete-ondametrica-nazionale/), the 
National Wave Network
* [Luoghi](http://dati.isprambiente.it/dataset/i-luoghi/), 
the data of the regions from the cartographic systems of ISPRA
</br>

The second project made available by ISPRA we used for creating FlooData is [IdroGEO](https://idrogeo.isprambiente.it/app/), a platform allowing consultation of download and sharing of data, maps, reports, documents of the Italian Landslide Inventory - IFFI. The platform has an [Open Data section](https://idrogeo.isprambiente.it/app/page/open-data) from which it is possible to download data concerning landslides, available in open format and with [CreativeCommons](https://creativecommons.org/) licences. 
</br>
</br>

The fourth platform we used is [MinERva](https://datacatalog.regione.emilia-romagna.it/catalogCTA/dataset).
MinERva is the point of reference and information sharing held by the Directorate General for Territory and Environment Care of the **[Region of Emilia Romagna](https://www.regione.emilia-romagna.it/)**. It contains various databases classified following the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network‚ÄØ[(CKAN)](https://ckan.org/) grouping and of the UN 2030 Agenda in [Sustainable Developement Goals](https://www.un.org/en/sustainable-development-goals) che √® un sistema‚ÄØopen source‚ÄØe‚ÄØbasato sul web‚ÄØper la raccolta, la catalogazione e la distribuzione di dati.
</br>
</br>

[OpenCoesione](https://opencoesione.gov.it/it/) ‚Äì the [Italian government](https://www.governo.it/)'s open gov initiative on cohesion policies in Italy ‚Äì makes available datasets offering a partial return of the monitoring system managed by the [State General Accounting](http://www.rgs.mef.gov.it/); in a form suitable to respond to the cognitive interests of citizens. In the [Open Data section](https://opencoesione.gov.it/it/opendata/#!progetti_section) datsets on projects are available for download and re-use.

The final data source employed in the constuction of FlooData datasets  is a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MatteoHenryChinaski/Comuni-Italiani-2018-Sql-Json-excel) by [Matteo Henry Chinaski](https://github.com/MatteoHenryChinaski). The author does not provide a licence or waiver for the data they created. However it is possible to collaborate and freely download data, withouth specifying any legal restricion. The data contained in this resource is of topologycal and topohographical nature as it contains places names, cxoordinates, istat codes, dimensions and  statistics (out of date) of different Italian areas, spanning from single municipalities to the entire natainal territory.

## üíé Quality analysis of the datasets
The following criteria must be met in order to manage the level of information quality as set out by the National Guidelines for the Improvement of Public Information Assets in the [Context of Data Quality](https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/lg-patrimonio-pubblico/it/bozza/aspettiorg.html#qualita-dei-dati):

* *Accurancy*: the data's properties accurately reflect the true worth of the concept or event being referenced;
* *Completness*: the data is comprehensive with regard to all of its expected values and the relevant entities (sources) that contribute to the definition of the procedure;
* *Coherence*: in terms of how the administration's owner uses the data, neither the data nor its attributes can be related to other data;
* *Promptness*: the data, and its attributes, is updated with respect to the procedure to which it refers.

## Legal analysis 
Legal analysis is required to ensure the long-term viability of the data generation and dissemination process, as well as to produce a balanced service that is in accordance with the public function and individual rights. As a result, the legal analysis of the sources seeks to assess these precarious balances, emphasising use restrictions, objectives of competence, right determination, and licence conditions.

## Ethical analysis 

Under an *ethical* point of view, we considered the importance of the human being, transparency, accountability, and equality. 
Along with this ethical aspects, we also considered other criteria such as sustainable re-use of the data gathered, and presence of information of public interest when choosing **FlooData**'s source data, as we wanted to account for the management of financings (Open Coesione), the presence risk of hydrogeological disasters in the whole area of Emilia-Romagna, the amount of preventive interventions and following reparations. 

The data gathered is managed by producers in a transparent way, as documentation on project and/or datasets, licences, and policies are made available to final users, avoiding cognitive biases and legal misunderstanding in terms of data re-use.


The original datasets mainly represent, envirnmental‚Äì and  geodata. This kind of data naturally avoids discriminations, stereotyping, crystallization, distortion of the history, misrepresentation of reality, and manipulation of the cultural identity of a country/community.
As averages the data gives information about the region as a whole and do not pose individual privacy risk.


Data relating to communities of people living in endangered area comes from the two sets coming from ISPRAS's project ***IdroGeo***. 
*D6* and *D7* contain information on families living in areas with high, medium and low flooding risk **(?)**. Even though this information is linked to natural persons, it is made available for public interest purposes, anonimized, and in form of statistical data, in compliance with the Art. 89 of GDPR. Additionally this kind of data ‚Äì when made public ‚Äì might be a call to action to sensibilize people on climate change and hydrogeological issues.
Finally, we noticed **ReNDis** makes accessible the names of whom is responsible for recordered interventions. We consider the presence of identity data in this set as legitimate, sice names of public officers are by nature of public domain. 

For ethical requirements we also rely on [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en)'s Data Ethics Decision Making Guidelines, in particular considering these aspectsl data gathered and presented on Floodata has been downloaded directly from sources website's or other institutional aggregators such as **MinERva** and **OpenCoesione**. 
The datasets used have all been made available for re-use by producers. The reuse of this data on FlooData, is consistent with creators's specific intent of displaying the hydrogeological situation of the studied area.

We take into account that there are chances of people acting on the collected information to look for more secure and mantained area within the region Emila Romagna, but that does not look like an ethical issue as much as a normal inferencial process granted to common citizens.

### Mashup and output datasets

All data processing tasks undertaken for creating the mashed-up datasets were carried out using Python versions 3.9 and 3.10 and built-in/open-source methods.

For creating the new datasets we disposed of two different kinds of file formats:

* NT
* DBF
* CSV
* JSON

#### Pre processing

**N-Triples** files needed to be preprocessed and parsed into datafames. 
To accomplish this we developed a script [rdf_parse.py](software/rdf_parser.py) to merge the ReNDi and Luoghi data in and create three dataframes, containing of data on hydrogeological disruptions, reparations and their financing. 
The script uses the ldflib to parse thr .nt files and through the class Thypology it gathers the main subjects we want to retrieve: instabilities, interventions(financings), and repairs.
Then for each subject we extracted predicates related to them and use them as labels for creating the dataframes' columns. 

For each column to be created we iterated triples formed as <*Object*><*Columnlabel*><*object*> and selected the corresponding object as that cell values.
For insertng geographical datawe started from ReNDiS lots locations and queried the Luoghi dataset loooking for their labels, province, latitude and longitude. 

The resulting dataframes have been temoporarly saved in .csv format for later merging with other datasets. 

**DBF** files have been converted automatically into csv files using the software dbf.py developed for this purpose. The software cnverts the files keeping their original names through the use of dbf_read librry's DBF method to open this kind of file, which is then saved in .csv format.

#### Merging 

The second step consists in the merging of the JSON and CSV files.

The original data has been mashed-up to create the FlooDatas's 4 datasets contained in our catalog.

Using our softwares actions.py and territory .py we created respectively MD1, and MD3/MD4. 

* **actions.py** selects all Emilia-Romagna's projects (subsetting the original dataset when necessary, e.g., DF1), and constructs the columns based on the information we selected from source dataframes. 
Resulting df is then saved into .json and .csv format for future visualization and consultation purposes. 

* **territory.py** is feeded with *DF6* and *DF7*. Here we select interesting classes from the IdroGeo's datasets such as percentages of risk and atention percentages of families, enterprises and cultural heritage. 
To create MD3 we crossed place names contained in D6 with data in *D10* to find with municipalities latitue and longitude coordinates.


Finally MD2 has been produced by selecting and giving a standard name to the columns representing data necessary for our project we the useful columns  of datasets on hydrogeological dissest.
The production workflow in visible in notebook  [Disruptions.ipynb](software/Disruptions.ipynb)

The resulting datasets are composed as listed:

In doing so, we adhered to the FAIR principles outlined in the [FAIR Data Management Guidelines in Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf). To put it another way, we worked to make our research data accessible, searchable, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).Those principles include 3 types of entities: data, metadata and infrastructure. Given the analysis, we can state that our research data are compliant with the FAIR principles.

**Findable:**

* (Meta)data are assigned a unique identifier: both the data we retrieved from the source datasets, the mashed up data, and the metadata we developed in accordance with the DCAT-AP are compatible with this point, providing URI.
* Data are described with rich metadata: we linked a substantial amount of DCAT-AP specification-compliant metadata to our data, including not only all required classes and their corresponding necessary characteristics but also certain suggested and optional features that were helpful for our data.
* Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe: we used the DCAT-AP optional attribute for datasets dct:identifier to attach a unique identifier of the data described with the metadata for each dataset that is a part of a catalogue as well as for our own dataset.

**Accessible:**

* (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol: all the data we collected and mashed up and the relative metadata are retrievable through the HTTP or its extension HTTPS.
* The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable: HTTP and HTTPS are compliant with these characteristics.
* Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available: metadata will remain accessible from the metadata web page of this web resource.

**Interoperable:**

* (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation: the mashed-up data was represented using JSON, CSV, and XML, and the metadata was described and organised using RDF using the Turtle syntax.
* (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles: 

**Reusable**

* Meta(data) is richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes: data and metadata are represented by a wide and varied set of labels, such as the date of data collection and change, the licence, the publisher, the originator, and their content.

* (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license: The FlooData datasets are made available under the terms of the [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode.it) Licence, which are specific to the dataset and associated metadata we provided.

* (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance: in the metadata encoding of our project, data provenance information is provided in a machine-readable way.

* (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards:
